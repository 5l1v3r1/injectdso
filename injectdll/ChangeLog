    * Use `StrCmpI()' instead of `StrCmp()' when comparing DLL names. On
      Microsoft Windows 8.1 "kernel32.dll" shows up as "KERNEL32.DLL".

    * Modified pipe SACL to include the low integrity label; sandboxed
      processes can now talk back to `injectdll' via "\\??\\pipe\\injectdll".
    * Added option "-s" which makes `injectdll' assume "kernel32.dll" is
      mapped at the same address in all processes.
    * Modified `GetRemoteDLLHandle()' to check if "injectdll.exe" and the target
      process have the same bitness. If they don't, weird situations arise.
    * Various cleanups in "main.c" and "pipe.c".
    * Removed CRLF line endings.
    * Added "Makefile.amd64"; builds a 64-bit binary.

    * First public release of `injectdll'.
